# arsa
An API server for geographic data.

To build production, type `make prod`.

To create the env for a new developer, run `make dev_env`.

# Objectives from assignment instructions:

- create an API server for a geographic database.

- implement CRUD operations on a related set of data stored in a database. (countries, states, and cities)

- deploy the project to the cloud using CI/CD.

- include a dozen or more endpoints.

- ensure all endpoints and functions have unit tests.

- thoroughly documented each endpoint for [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).

- Natural Disasters ([earthquakes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/earthquake-dataset), [tsunamis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/tsunami-dataset))
